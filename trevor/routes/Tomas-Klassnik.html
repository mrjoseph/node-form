<p>Tomas Klassnik is the man behind the Klassnik Corporation, a London-based interdisciplinary design practice focusing on architectural research. In addition to his work as a chartered architect, he teaches, dreams up arts strategies and dabbles in spiritualism.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about working on Peter Moro&rsquo;s house.</strong> We are working on the partial refurbishment of a fantastic Grade II listed Modernist house in Blackheath, built in 1957 by the architect Peter Moro for himself. The project includes the creation of a new bathroom, sauna area and home office and, as such, involves integrating contemporary technologies within the constraints of the existing structure without compromising the minimal aesthetic of the building. It has been fascinating to dissect the building&rsquo;s fabric and get a sense of Moro&rsquo;s original thought process, almost translating from building to drawing &ndash; the reverse of how we would normally operate.</p>
<p><strong>Which is your favourite of his buildings? </strong>Having worked with it intimately for the past year I would have to say his house. The split internal floor levels give it a great sense of spatial dynamism, and the large areas of glazing connect the living areas directly to the landscape, bringing light and life into the interiors. The only other building of his that I have experienced is the Royal Festival Hall, which shares some of these characteristics, but I prefer the intimacy of the house.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a design philosophy?</strong> Our work is diverse. We call the practice a 'corporation', and we are interested in how architectural discourse can be pursued through a variety of fields beyond bricks and mortar. Recently this has included artworks and wildflower meadows for the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, landscape-scale drawing machines, pop-up shops for large brands, and even a s&eacute;ance to contact Le Corbusier. Currently we are working on a series of high street frontages in Waltham Forest, a film set to host a tiger and an alligator as part of a documentary, and several residential projects.</p>
<p>Trying to find a strong narrative and polemical completeness within the specific context of each project is critical. I&rsquo;ve always admired installation artists and how, through choreography of materials, objects, concepts and spaces, they can create meaningful experiences with wit, intensity and clarity, a process I try to replicate.</p>
<p><strong>If you could redesign one London building, which one would it be? </strong>The Tower of London. Not because it's a bad building but because, following all the development that has grown up surrounding it, it could do with a helping hand to reclaim its symbolic position within London's skyline. Augmenting it into a skyscraper with a unique materiality and symbolic value would be a great project.</p>
<p><strong>After your s&eacute;ance with Le Corbusier, which dead architect might you contact next?</strong> Nicholas Hawksmoor (1661&ndash;1736) would be interesting to speak to. He is a relatively enigmatic character with a fully fledged interest in the occult and masonic symbolism, so he might be quite easy to get hold of. His church buildings are brilliant, particularly Christ Church in Spitalfields, which would make a great venue for the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a favourite fictional architect?</strong> Strangely, there are a lot to choose from! Tom Selleck in <em>Three Men and a Baby</em> stands out for me as exemplifying the tendency to view architects as a balance of someone responsible enough to remember a birthday and creative enough to do something interesting for it. He also shows off a fine selection of braces and bow ties alongside his authoritative moustache.</p>
